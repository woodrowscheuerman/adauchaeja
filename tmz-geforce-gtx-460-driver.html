Hey, all. I've been dealing with this problem for quite awhile now, trying to get it solved on my own and I'm hoping someone here has any ideas. I have 2 EVGA GeForce GTX 460s. The primary one is a v2, the other is not. Whenever I run games in DX10 or 11 (specifically Saints Row 3, FarCry 3, Battlefield 3 and Bioshock Infinite), either the display driver stops responding, or the game "encounters a problem and needs to close."
