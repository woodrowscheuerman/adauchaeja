There's a lot of songs that I enjoy and I really want to add my own little twist to them, without having to tediously transcribe the songs. I figured there must be a better easier way to do this , so I did a quick search on google, but I didn't find anything I felt like would be getting what I want through my search. How ever I did learn about some audio to midi polyphonic transcribers, I was wondering which ones you all would recommend. Or perhaps there is a different way of going at this. Данная сборка создавалась таким образом, чтобы без проблем работать на максимальном количестве компьютеров (т. е. обеспечить максимальную совместимость). Anyone know of a program that will convert an audio file to a MIDI file? It doesn't have to work great (glitchy is better). I'd just like to take a solo instrumental track and then be able to play it from a soft-synth for "flavor". Like I said, it would probably be more interesting if it didn't work with 100% accuracy. Добавьте ссылки на источники, предметом рассмотрения которых является тема настоящей статьи (или раздела) в целом, а не отдельные элементы списка. I'd like to start analyzing some of my favorite pro songs to see what exactly they are doing with chord progressions/melody/scale/etc. I have a pretty basic understanding of music theory and trying to use this as a way to be able to expand the knowledge and be able to apply more quickly vs. just reading about it. Are there websites that breakdown songs into chord progressions/melodies? I've used Ableton's audio to midi converter and get mixed results on that. Thanks.

BUT i have a E- guitar, so I had this crazy idea. Technically i could use link related to connect the headphone output from my amp to my mic input on my computer right?

I'm currently doing a music and sound engineering course, where the predominantly used DAW is Cubase; it's got me out of my FL Studio comfort zone to say the least. Anyway, in Cubase I've stumbled across two functions which I'm interested to know feature in FL Studio at all or indeed as an alternate plugin. One is an audio to midi converter which seems like the best thing since sliced bread and the other is a chord builder which recommends where to go with your progressions. Does anybody RealPlayer позволяет искать, просматривать и загружать файлы – FLV, MP4, а также загружать видео на сервисы Facebook и Twitter, работать с устройствами iPod, iPhone, BlackBerry I'm still Traverso (скачать) - тем, кто опробует интерфейс мультитрекового редактора Traverso, вначале может показаться, что эта программа мало на что способна.

Are there differences in audio quality in the MIDI to USB converter cable or are they like HDMI in that they either work or don't? Have a full size electric piano that I want to hook into my DAW and need the converter cable, but have no experience with these cables. Would love to go the cheap route. # Disclaimer: OSC Support in Dreams has been temporarily removed (https://indreams.me/docs/updates) since v1.02. # midi2osc Media Molecule co-founder and technical director Alex Evans wrote a little program (midi2osc) (https://github.com/mmalex/midi2osc) that converts MIDI signals to OSC messages and works out of the box with Dreams. Installation + usage instructions are on the github page. You basically install the program on your PC/laptop, insert your local PS4 IP and connect a MIDI instr. I saw someone posted a list of free sound libraries here and figured some of you might be interested in rolling your own music using free and open source software. I remembered I had this old list of audio software for Linux. I apologize in advance if some of these links no longer work but a quick google will point you in the right direction. Once you get the hang of it Linux audio is incredibly flexible and creative but there is a bit of a learning curve.one that I found very rewarding. # Audio Mastering 101: Guide to Improving Your Audio on stream! Just a quick introduction; I'm Mr.Goodhand. Today marks the first day I seriously am considering transitioning to Mixer from Twitch. I started streaming awhile back, on twitch, but found its severe level of over saturation to be.a bit.over the top these days. I made several guides on the twitch sub-reddit involving audio, and I wanted to share them with the mixer community. Utilization of these audio techniques is purely. 
I want to upgrade my audio interface and I am a little confused on audio interfaces. If your mainly a electronic music type producer (EDM, Synthwave etc) who does little to no recording of analog sources like guitars, vocals or any kind of instrument for that matter than you really don't need a fast computer connection like Thunderbolt right.? From what I have seen and heard.They say if you are a electronic music producer, than you don't need fast connection speeds like thunderbolt since. Hey everybody, I’m trying to come up with solutions for not having a CV signal producing sequencer. (ideally and eventually, I’ll pick up an analog four mk1). What I do have is a monomachine mkII and was thinking if I used a midi to CV converter it would solve some problems and a with all its audio outs, I was wondering about an audio to cv converter too. Any thoughts on this would be most appreciated, thanks. So you'd like to develop for the Nintendo 64, but don't really know where to start? I'll give you a run-down of things you'll need to either hack/translate your favourite games, along with a list of resources where you can code and develop N64 Games. Some things you'll need (or should have) are either a 64Drive HW2 or an Everdrive V3 (this version has the usb port), MIPS/ASM experience, a Hex Editor (or Calculator) and experience with C programming , along with a Cycle-. I didn't see a MOTU hardware subreddit, so I figure I'll ask here, see if anyone has any input. I have been running MOTU Digital Performer for many many years, I've been using a few different MOTU interfaces. I currently run a 2408mkIII interface, audiowired to a PCIe424 card in my maxed out Mac Pro cheesgrater. the main output volume control is faulty, so one channel of the main out does not turn down all the way, making it hard to get a good L/R balance. Hello! I'm currently working at a game company where I'm bringing my own laptop and working with my headphones and midi keyboard. I have a quiet corner of a shared office and it's pretty quiet so external noise is not a problem. So my question is, now that I'm not recording anything at the office with an external audio interface, do I need to use one or can I stick with the integrated one in my laptop? I know what an audio interface does (sort of), so I realise that the DA converter. Hello All! I've been lurking on this sub for some time now and have only recently really started diving deep into synthesis. After spending a few months doing research and saving up I've managed to collect a few instruments and I'm interested in beginning to record some song ideas I've scratched up. The only problem is that I'm a novice when it comes to tracking things; I've done some work in Audacity and GarageBand before, but even then I feel like I wasn't doing things properly Tl;Dr at the bottom I am a tactile person. I need knobs. Faders. Keys. You name it. I searched all over the internet for a solution, where I can either mix with the built in channel strip inside FL studios mixer (either through daw integration or midi linking) or routing 8-16 of my mixer channels to an analog mixer and then routing the stereo out back into FL studio as a master. I found it really hard to find out if and how this is possible, what pros and cons it has, what the workflow. Hi! Anybody have a minute and want to give me any feedback on a project I'm working on? The schematic can be found here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/3za9uyzr2n8b2sq/fractalbox-dev-schematic.pdf?dl=0). I can't for the life of me figure out how to get Kicad to give me a high enough resolution screenshot, so here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0wlo3tvmfs5vx4/fractalbox-dev.kicad_pcb?dl=0) is the actual layout project file if anybody cares enough to open that up. So I'll just run through 
Hi, I bought this usb to midi cable (https://www.amazon.it/Asmuse-Interface-Converter-Strumenti-Professionale/dp/B07CC4B9L4) for my Yamaha p140. Plugged it in on all 3 ports (usb in pc, midi in/out in the in/out ports on keyboard). I'd like to use it with musescore to automatically input notes in the sheets. However, it's recognized by Windows 10 simply as USB 2.0 MIDI and in its properties it says "Game, Video, Audio Controller" and "USB Speakers". Testing with Musicsoft fail and it doesn't. Hi Guys, I have been having issues for a long time with being able to record any of my hardware instruments onto my PC. I've had issues with a ground loop, which I think I have now solved but am left with a problem with noise from the Volca Sample and Volca Beats units. I have a UMC404HD Audio interface which I use to connect a Korg Monologue, which can be recorded with no problems or buzzing. However when connected to the interface, when turned on the volca devices generate hum. I should mentio. I made a post previously, but I had no Tx capable of it at that point, and now I do. I now own a Taranis X9D, and would like to start working out how to send flight control input to the drone using a PC. From what I understand, there are two main options: 1. Send ?PPM? data to the Tx via an audio cable plugged into the Trainer port. 2. Use a custom OpenTx firmware (Mentioned in this thread (https://openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=6538), I think it is referring to this projec.
