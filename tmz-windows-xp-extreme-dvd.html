Long story short, i'm a twitch streamer and one of my subs messaged me today out of the blue and he bought me all of these parts. The thing is through, payment has been done and the parts are already on processing. I couldn't believe it at first but i made sure it wasn't some sort of joke. We're talking 7/8k right? Anyways, i wanted you guys to give me a rundown on what i have on my hands. Are the parts even compatible? Tell me something. Case COOLERMASTER COSMOS C700P TOWER GAMING.

So as the title suggest I had a computer built for me by digital storm from 2009 ish and its now time to upgrade some components such as a graphics card and hard drive to probably a 1T. Now I am just wondering if I am in over my head to trying to upgrade what I have or should I just keep saving for a gaming laptop as I do some traveling. 4k capable would be nice but I don't really care about that high of resolution. I mainly want to just be able to run some simulators such as Microsoft flight.

So that means Windows XP, Intel Extreme Graphics (!!!), 128 MB RAM (Wow, so much), a failing motherboard and CPU, a broken case, mouse, keyboard and speakers. They are frankly sick of this. So they told me, right, Windows 10 comes out soon, so does the Witcher 3, GTA V, Arkham Knight etc. so we want a PC for this, but we want to make sure this is a productive Really Wanted a Light Weight Less Heat But Powerful 15" (Yoga 720, X1 Carbon, Dell XPS 15 but way out of my budget unless I find some lucky sale or your idea for another used / refurb alternative?).

So, I installed the Remote NDIS driver and USB Tethered my Android phone to get WiFi. Note: I do not have any Service Pack installed. So I'd need updates, won't I? I went to Control Panel and clicked on Windows Updates. It launched Internet Explorer and I got a DNS Error. I can't access any other sites except MSN.

I am not an IT professional of any sort, but am an avid gamer and have been building my own computers and helping people with their own PC issues for about 5 or 6 years now (yeah, I'm the computer guy for my friends/family). Every now and then I see people seeking help on r/starcraft for getting a computer that will run Starcraft 2 at various settings and in different price ranges, or they have technical issues, so I decided to make a post that will attempt to address some of these issues. So my first gaming PC died a few weeks ago, so I decided it's time for me to build a new machine. I plan to do mostly gaming, but with the occasional Photoshop, video editing, and live streaming. Please critique my build. I also do plan to re-lid my CPU with the Rockit Cool kit and Arctic Silver 5.

Hi guys. April 2014 and XP end of support is approaching. I'm wondering if there could be some kind of interest in giving some love to Xp substitution by a Linux distro. This could be a section of LAS, like once upon a time was Android picks segment or a LAS+LUP dedicated episode. I rember myself one year ago on this item: I was the more confused on what was the best distro for me, Xp user, the more I read here and there on internet - then I took a deep breath and I jumped on Xubuntu 12.04. Part 2 here, i guess. Ive decided on all my parts, with much thanks to you guys as well as my own research. As i posted before, my previous pc had served me well for a long time, but its now ready to be put out to pasture. I was always into pc gaming, so i decided to forgoe getting any more consoles and just join the pc crew exclusively. Also, i just turned 33 this month, and before turning gray and being too old to enjoy pc games, i went high end on this build. Heres what i got! PCPartPicker. First time posting in TFTS. I will try to make this as concise as possible. Backstory TL;DR: Met woman, charmed her with tech skills, received job. Backstory: I was consulted by my grandfather's company to build a computer for my brother, who provides metal fabrication services to my grandfather's company. He needs a computer more powerful than a ( shiver ) Dell Dimension 8300 to run programs like SolidWorks, etc. I went to Fry's Electronics to purchase the parts, and came across. The first PC I built was in 2002 and it was last updated in 2005. It took a few weeks to get up to speed on all the new technology. In the end, it's basically the same experience, except everything is faster, hotter and has more fans to keep it cool. Ironically it was for Planetside and this build is for Planetside2. I'm hoping it's going to live up to the hype. My biggest decision was to go with a 7850 GPU and 1080p monitor or 670 with 1440p monitor. I decided that one 1080p monitor. #Welcome windows Refugees, welcome to GNU/Linux Microsoft will terminate support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.
